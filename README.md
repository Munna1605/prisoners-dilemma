# Evolving strategies for the Prisoner's Dilemma

The [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a traditional game model for studying decision making and self-interest. This Java software provides an environment in which strategies for the Prisoner's Dilemma can be evolved, analysed and interacted with. It includes genetic algorithms for strategy evolution and a spatial variant of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game. This software also provides a means of varying the evolutionary parameters and game rules, and facilitates analysis of the resulting behaviours.
